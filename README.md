# Tamarack Treks- Outdoor Gear and Trail Resource
## A gear and trail resource for hikers and campers in southwestern Montana

This project is a demo outdoor enthusiast guide written in Python.

## Something here about making it...
**Languages/tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, Jinja, SQLLite, Bootstrap

This project was written mostly in Python. I wanted to create a fairly straightforward webpage that utilized a number
of my skills. To that end: 
* I utilized Flask's Application Factory pattern to create a multi-page web application
* I created an effective Python search engine from scratch
* I used SQLLite to create a database to store all gear and trail related information on my site
* Using the Beautiful Soup library, I created a constantly running web scraper to automate database updates
* I designed each web page myself using original CSS code and some Bootstrap

## Takeaways
This is the first completely original, fully functional application I've ever made and, as such, there were *a lot* of
hard lessons learned.


Tamarack Treks is only intended as a demo and, as such, it is extrememly light on content.
